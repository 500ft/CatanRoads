"""Synthetic surface-disturbance scenes for validating candidate extraction.

The whole point of a synthetic generator is that ground truth is known, so the
extractor can be measured (recall on corridors, rejection of blobs and noise)
without any real imagery — which keeps tooling development independent of the
Phase-1 data gate.
