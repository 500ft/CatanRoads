"""Gate the synthetic method demo on numbers rather than on image pixels.

results/method_demo_synthetic.png cannot be diffed usefully across machines: font
rasterisation differs between freetype builds, so the title and footer text bands change
by hundreds of pixels while every data pixel is identical. Comparing PNG bytes therefore
reports drift that does not exist, and would hide real drift in the noise.

So the demo's *numeric* output is pinned instead: the scene fingerprint and the extracted
candidate geometry, recorded in results/method_demo_synthetic.numeric.json. If the
extractor or the synthetic scene ever changes, this fails with the offending number.
