# CatanRoads — Six-day evidence-integrity sprint

Prepared: 2026-09-05. Budget: 30 focused hours; optional Day 7 adds at most 4 hours for owner review only. Days are effort groupings, not unattended calendar commitments. Status lives only in [SPRINT_TASKS.csv](SPRINT_TASKS.csv).

## A. Outcome and baseline identity

A reproducible, fail-closed Phase-1 evidence intake and locally verified CI configuration that distinguishes QA runs from eligible Mongolia disturbance-screening results; real-site claims remain blocked until reference verification.

Publication-state update (2026-09-06): the owner authorized local commits, branch
pushes, and pull requests for this sprint. This does not authorize deployment,
research publication, outreach, spending, or any blocked physical/data action.

Audience: engineering/research reviewer and graduate-application portfolio reader.
Canonical sprint checkout: `/Users/redhose/Developer/research-sprints/2026-09-05/CatanRoads`.
Remote: https://github.com/500ft/CatanRoads. Base: `690c2fcf88bbe689bd006cce91863821a39edb2a`.
Branch: `sprint/evidence-integrity-20260905`. Prepared from freshly fetched origin/main, not from original dirty drafts.
Original checkout: `/Users/redhose/.graphify/repos/500ft/CatanRoads`; preserved. New sprint checkout was clean before evidence capture. No commit, push, publication, purchase, deployment or outreach is claimed or planned as an automatic action.

## B. Verified baseline and priority gaps

Verified: config/sites.geojson has six unverified starting guesses; GEE candidateMask is positive disturbance, including a recovering site whose expected sign is opposite. Current gate counts large components, not roads. No installed .github/workflows exists; proposed patch is not active CI.

Sources inspected: [config/sites.geojson](../config/sites.geojson), [gee/ndvi_change.js](../gee/ndvi_change.js), [tools/validate_phase1.mjs](../tools/validate_phase1.mjs), [docs/design.md](../docs/design.md), [README.md](../README.md), [analysis/pyproject.toml](../analysis/pyproject.toml), [ci-proposed/README.md](../ci-proposed/README.md).
[Actual baseline command outputs](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/baseline.json) record working directories, runtime versions, outputs and exit statuses. Alleged defects become reproduced failures only when the red tests record them. Test counts are not research performance.

Verified existing commands (repository root; local Python may need the recorded readline workaround):

```sh
PYTHONPATH=analysis python -c 'import sys, types; sys.modules["readline"] = types.ModuleType("readline"); import pytest; raise SystemExit(pytest.main(["-q"]))'
node tools/validate_phase1.mjs
```

No separately configured typechecker/linter was found in this scoped configuration. Use compileall for changed Python, relevant tests, existing CI commands and `git diff --check`; do not call syntax compilation a typecheck. Proposed test/CLI paths below do not exist until implemented.

## C. Scope, ownership and critical path

Must-haves: repaired claim/validation boundary; regression evidence including original failures; consistent operative scope; reproducible local delivery/check commands; review index identifying unresolved external work.
Exclusions: No network graph/OSM tracing implementation, active/abandoned classifier, coordinate guesses relabeled verified, retuned preregistered thresholds, or claimed Mongolia results.
Owner/External dependencies: Dated imagery/site verification and Earth Engine runtime credentials are not supplied. The existing unverified sites remain unverified. Hosted Actions requires a separately authorized push.
Critical path: baseline → regression failure → minimal correction → full affected checks → candidate identity/selection freeze → bounded evaluation → review packet. Prepare owner requests on Day1; replies do not block independent code fixes. External feedback is not presumed.

## D. Daily budget

September6 reconciliation: owner resource/reference actions start on Day1 rather
than after the evaluation packet. This moves two estimated hours forward; total
remains30. External turnaround is not compressed by this workload allocation.

| Day | Hours | Primary deliverable |
|---|---:|---|
| 1 | 7 | Baseline/scope (5 Agent hours), early resource/provenance action (2 Owner hours) |
| 2 | 5 | Make eligibility a tested executable gate |
| 3 | 6 | Install local CI workflow and reconcile sign/scope |
| 4 | 4 | Freeze intake candidate and real-data run instructions |
| 5 | 6 | Evaluate selected real sites if eligible; otherwise fail-closed delivery evaluation |
| 6 | 2 | Review packet; external feedback remains conditional |
| Total | 30 | Local evidence-ready candidate or explicitly partial handoff |

## F. Evaluation and overrun policy

Existing audit counterexamples and all tests inspected while fixing are development evidence, not held-out evaluation. Before Day5, freeze a candidate source/diff identity and selection procedure; save expected judgments before predictions where meaningful. Any observed case used to fix the candidate becomes development material; record that and select new cases for a revised candidate. Hashes identify bytes, not independence. No AI peer is called an independent human reviewer.

If the implementation consumes extra time, cut optional model breadth, cosmetic changes and additional fixtures; never relax numerical thresholds, remove rejection checks or relabel missing measurements. Day7 may add up to4 owner-review hours (34 maximum) only by explicit rebaseline. Do not convert lab lead time into nominal coding hours. Stop affected work at missing authority; proceed with independent authorized tasks. Unavailable external evidence produces a partial handoff, not a completed empirical claim.

Follow-up review checks: reproduce original failures and repaired counterexamples, repeat real commands, inspect runtime and evidence provenance, distinguish local tests from hosted/deployed/physical outcomes, and assess scientific wording independently.

## G. Execution record and first action

[Ledger](SPRINT_TASKS.csv) · [Progress](SPRINT_PROGRESS.md) · [Review index](REVIEW_READY.md).
First behavior-changing action: CR-03; write its regression input, observe failure on baseline, then make the minimal correction. User has authorized plan-and-execute now. No additional start confirmation is required for this bounded scope.
