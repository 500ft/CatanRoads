# Informal Road Mapping

Screen persistent surface disturbance for candidate informal-road corridors in
Mongolia, then test those candidates against dated reference imagery.

*Method overview, not a satellite result. Real-site evaluation and network
conditioning remain gated. [Visual provenance](docs/REPOSITORY_IDENTITY.md#visual-provenance).*

## Overview

A change map is not a road detector: vegetation, agriculture, riverbeds and
weather can all produce strong signals. This project targets **corridor-scale
positive surface disturbance**, not individual sub-pixel tire tracks or inferred
traffic volume.

The research path combines same-season Sentinel-2 composites with a quantitative
negative control, then evaluates line-like candidates. OpenStreetMap conditioning
is a planned ranking/ablation step—not a requirement that every road touch an
existing mapped node.

| Component | Purpose | Present state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Earth Engine screening | Fuse vegetation-loss and exposed-surface signals, local controls and persistence | Code and static checks; real-site gate unrun |
| Python extraction | Identify elongated components in disturbance rasters | Tested on known-truth synthetic scenes |
| Admission checks | Require consistent exports, site provenance and control comparisons | Tested command-line gate |
| Reference inspection | Establish what the registered sites actually contain | Worksheets prepared; all six sites unverified |
| Network conditioning | Compare seeded and unseeded candidates | Planned |

## Evidence

![Known-truth synthetic scene and candidate corridor extraction; not real Mongolia imagery](results/method_demo_synthetic.png)

*The existing synthetic demonstration exercises curved, braided and broken
corridors alongside a round-blob confound. Its historical “Catan Roads” caption
is retained with the original artifact; the Python package remains
`catanroads`. This is development evidence, not real-road accuracy.*

- [Extractor and numerical demonstration tests](analysis/tests/) retain known-truth cases.
- [Phase-1 runbook](docs/PHASE1_RUNBOOK.md) defines the data-admission and negative-control checks.
- [Site-verification worksheet](docs/SITE_VERIFICATION_WORKSHEET.md) is derived from the canonical manifest and omits the untouched holdout.
- [Figure provenance](docs/data-and-figures.md) distinguishes conceptual graphics, synthetic demonstrations and legacy imagery.

No real-road precision/recall, active/abandoned classification or Mongolia
detection result is claimed. The earlier NDVI rendering in `results/` is not
a successful Phase-1 output.

## Getting started

The local check route needs **Python 3.10+** and **Node.js 22** (the CI version).
It needs no Earth Engine credentials and does not inspect imagery.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/500ft/informal-road-mapping.git
cd informal-road-mapping
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e "analysis[dev]"
PYTHONPATH=analysis python -m pytest analysis/tests -q
node tools/validate_phase1.mjs
node tools/test_temporal_qa.mjs
PYTHONPATH=analysis python -m catanroads.site_worksheet --check
```

Expected: local tests and static checks pass; worksheet consistency passes
**without changing any site-verification flags**. These checks are not an Earth
Engine execution or a field-validation verdict.

For the optional synthetic plot command, local-environment workaround and
gated Earth Engine route, see [Start here](docs/START_HERE.md).

## Next milestone

Complete the registered development-site and road-free-control imagery review
**before seeing candidate predictions**, then run the frozen Phase-1 comparison.
The authoritative requirements remain in the [design](docs/design.md) and
[task ledger](docs/SPRINT_TASKS.csv); this overview does not change them.

Do not substitute sites after seeing an inconvenient result. Keep the holdout
uninspected until the candidate and evaluation procedure are frozen.

## Limits that matter

- Vegetation and bare-soil indices share bands; their agreement is not independent confirmation.
- Stable bare roads may not change. Revegetation has the opposite sign to the positive-disturbance gate.
- The recovering-site role therefore does not establish recovery detection; any new sign-aware experiment needs a prospective amendment.
- Passing synthetic tests does not establish accuracy in Mongolia or robustness to agricultural confounds.
- Reference-image access and redistribution follow the original provider's terms.
